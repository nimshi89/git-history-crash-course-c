## Overview + Scope

This repository is part of a 3 part crash course on rewriting Git history. It is intended to be used in conjunction with ONS' guidance on rewriting Git history if a sensitive file has been committed to a repository. The purpose of this repository is to test the steps outlined in the guidance, and to provide a practical example of how to rewrite Git history.

The process outlined within the guidance is available within each scenario repository. See [this flowchart](./process_flowchart.png) for an overview of the process.

## Other Scenarios

- [Scenario 1: Last commit contains the secret by itself](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-a)
- [Scenario 2: Last commit contains the secret with other changes](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-b)
- [Scenario 3: A previous commit contains the secret](https://github.com/ONS-Innovation/git-history-crash-course-c)

## How to use this repository

2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Read [the scenario](#the-scenario) below.
4. Follow the process outlined in the [guidance flowchart](./process_flowchart.png) to rewrite the Git history.
5. Once you have completed the process, push your changes to your fork.
